# Dotfiles
Collection of my personal dotfiles for:
* vim
* zsh
* tmux
* awesome-wm
* i3-wm

Some of the files aren't mine (e.g. Lain), I left copyright information in those to identify them.

I no longer use the following programs but have held onto their dotfiles:
* termite

I usually just clone this somewhere into `$HOME` and symlink the files to where
I need.
